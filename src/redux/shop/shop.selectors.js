// except this time we're memoizing the return of our function which returns our selector

// By wrapping this function in memoize, we're saying that whenever this function gets called
// and receives collectionUrlParam, I want to memoize the return of this function (in this case
// we return a selector). If this function gets called again with the same collectionUrlParam,
// don't rerun this function because we'll return the same value as last time, which we've
// memoized so just return the selector that's been stored.
